# acme-certificate

Allows to obtain certificates from Let's Encrypt with minimal interaction with the webserver. Most code is executed on the controller, and the account key is never send to the nodes.

## Description

This is an [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) role which can use any CA supporting the ACME protocol, such as [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), to issue TLS/SSL certificates for your server. This role requires Ansible 2.8.0 or newer and is based on the [acme_certificate module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/acme_certificate_module.html) coming with Ansible.

(If you prefer the [acme_compact](https://github.com/felixfontein/acme-compact) based version, you can check out the [acme_compact_version branch](https://github.com/felixfontein/acme-certificate/tree/acme_compact_version).)

The main advantage of this approach over others is that *almost no code is executed on your webserver*: only when you use HTTP challenges, files need to be copied onto your webserver, and afterwards deleted from it. Everything else is executed on your local machine!

(This does not cover installing the certificates, you have to do that yourself in another role.)

## Requirements

Requires the Python [cryptography](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/49568) library installed on the controller, available to the Python version used to execute the playbook. If `cryptography` is not installed, a recent enough version of [PyOpenSSL](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/) is currently supported as a fallback by the Ansible `openssl_privatekey` and `openssl_csr` modules.

The `openssl` binary must also be available in the executable path on the controller. It is needed by the `acme_certificate` module in case `cryptography` is not installed, and it is used for certificate chain validation.

If DNS challenges are used, there can be other requirements depending on the DNS provider. For example, for Amazon's Route 53, the Ansible `route53` module requires the Python `boto` package.

## Account Key Setup

You can create an account key using the `openssl` binary as follows:

    # RSA 4096 bit key
    openssl genrsa 4096 -out keys/acme-account.key
    # ECC 256 bit key (P-256)
    openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out keys/acme-account.key
    # ECC 384 bit key (P-384)
    openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -out keys/acme-account.key

With Ansible, you can use the `openssl_privatekey` module as follows:

    - name: Generate RSA 4096 key
      openssl_privatekey:
        path: keys/acme-account.key
        type: RSA
        size: 4096
    - name: Generate ECC 256 bit key (P-256)
      openssl_privatekey:
        path: keys/acme-account.key
        type: ECC
        curve: secp256k1
    - name: Generate ECC 384 bit key (P-384)
      openssl_privatekey:
        path: keys/acme-account.key
        type: ECC
        curve: secp384r1

Make sure you store the account key safely. As opposed to certificate private keys, there is no need to regenerate it frequently, and it makes recovation of certificates issued with it very simple.

## Role Variables

These are the main variables:

- `acme_account`: Path to the private ACME account key. Must always be specified.
- `acme_email`: Your email address which shall be associated to the ACME account. Must always be specified.
- `algorithm`: The algorithm used for creating private keys. The default is `"rsa"`; other choices are `"p-256"`, `"p-384"` or `"p-521"` for the NIST elliptic curves `prime256v1`, `secp384r1` and `secp521r1`, respectively.
- `key_length`: The bitlength to use for RSA private keys. The default is 4096.
- `key_name`: The basename for storing the keys and certificates. The default is the first domain specified, with `*` replaced by `_`.
- `keys_path`: Where the keys and certificates are stored. Default value is `"keys/"`.
- `keys_old_path`: Where old keys and certificates should be copied to; used in case `keys_old_store` is true. Default value is `"keys/old/"`.
- `keys_old_store`: If set to `true`, will make copies of old keys and certificates. The copies will be stored in the directory specified by `keys_old_store`. Default value is `false`.
- `keys_old_prepend_timestamp`: Whether copies of old keys and certificates should be prepended by the current date and time. Default value is `false`.
- `ocsp_must_staple`: Whether a certificate with the OCSP Must Staple extension is requested. Default value is `false`.
- `agreement`: The terms of service document the user agrees to. Default value is `https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf`.
- `acme_directory`: The ACME directory to use. Default is `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`, which is the current production ACME v2 endpoint of Let's Encrypt.
- `acme_version`: The ACME directory's version. Default is 2. Use 1 for ACME v1.
- `challenge`: The challenge type to use. Should be `http-01` for HTTP challenges (needs access to web server) or `dns-01` for DNS challenges (needs access to DNS provider).
- `root_certificate`: The root certificate for the ACME directory. Default value is `https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem` for the root certificate of Let's Encrypt.
- `deactivate_authzs`: Whether `authz`s (authorizations) should be deactivated afterwards. Default value is `true`. Set to `false` to be able to re-use `authz`s.
- `modify_account`: Whether the ACME account should be created (if it doesn't exist) and the contact data (email address) should be updated. Default value is `true`. Set to `false` if you want to use the `acme_account` module to manage your ACME account.
- `privatekey_mode`: Which file mode to use for the private key file. Default value is `"0600"`, which means read- and writeable by the owner, but not accessible by anyone else (except possibly `root`).

### HTTP Challenges

For HTTP challenges, the following variables define how the challenges can be put onto the (remote) webserver:

- `server_location`: Location where `.well-known/acme-challenge/` will be served from. Default is `/var/www/challenges`.
- `http_become`: Argument for `become:` for the `file` and `copy` tasks. Default value is `false`.
- `http_challenge_user`: The user the challenge files are owned by. Default value is `root`.
- `http_challenge_group`: The group the challenge files are owned by. Default value is `http`.
- `http_challenge_folder_mode`: The mode to use for the challenge folder. Default value is `0750` (octal).
- `http_challenge_file_mode`: The mode to use for the challenge files. Default value is `0640` (octal).

The following subsection shows how to configure [nginx](https://nginx.org/) for HTTP challenges. Configuring other webservers can be done in a similar way.

#### Nginx configuration

Assume that for one of your TLS/SSL protected domains, you use a HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect. Let's assume it looks like this:

    server {
        listen       example.com:80;
        server_name  example.com *.example.com;
        return 301   https://www.example.com$request_uri;
    }

To allow the `acme-certificate` role to put something at `http://*.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/`, you can change this to:

    server {
        listen       example.com:80;
        server_name  example.com *.example.com;
        location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
            alias /var/www/challenges/;
            try_files $uri =404;
        }
        location / {
            return 301   https://www.example.com$request_uri;
        }
    }

With this nginx config, all other URLs on `*.example.com` and `example.com` are still redirected, while everything in `*.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/` is served from `/var/www/challenges`. When adjusting the location of `/var/www/challenges`, you must also change `server_location`.

You can even improve on this by redirecting all URLs in `*.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/` which do not resolve to a valid file in `/var/www/challenges` to your HTTPS server as well. One way to do this is:

    server {
        listen       example.com:80;
        server_name  example.com *.example.com;
        location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
            alias /var/www/lechallenges/;
            try_files $uri @forward_https;
        }
        location @forward_https {
            return 301   https://www.example.com$request_uri;
        }
        location / {
            return 301   https://www.example.com$request_uri;
        }
    }

With this config, if `/var/www/challenges/` is empty, your HTTP server will behave as if the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` location isn't specified.

### DNS Challenges

If DNS challenges are used, the following variables define how the challenges can be fulfilled:

- `dns_provider`: must be one of `route53`, `hosttech` or `gcdns`. Each needs more information:
  - For `route53` (Amazon Route 53), the credentials must be passed as `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key`.
  - For `hosttech` (hosttech GmbH, requires external [hosttech_dns_record module](https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-hosttech)).
  - For `gcdns` (Google Cloud DNS), the files `tasks/dns-gcdns-*.yml` need to be adjusted to add required credentials. See the documentation of the [gcdns_record module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/gcdns_record_module.html).

Please note that the DNS challenge code is experimental. The Route 53 and Hosttech functionality has been tested. Also, the code tries to extract the DNS zone from the domain by taking the last two components separated by dots. This will fail for example for `.co.uk` domains or other nested zones.

Support for more DNS providers can be added by adding `tasks/dns-NAME-create.yml` and `tasks/dns-NAME-cleanup.yml` files with similar content as in the existing files. Ansible modules of interest are [azure_rm_dnsrecordset](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/azure_rm_dnsrecordset_module.html) for Azure, [os_recordset](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_recordset_module.html) for OpenStack, [rax_dns_record](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/rax_dns_record_module.html) for RackSpace, and [udm_dns_record](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/udm_dns_record_module.html) for univention corporate servers (UCS).

## Account key conversion

Note that this Ansible role expects the Let's Encrypt account key to be in PEM format and not in JWK format, which is used by the [official Let's Encrypt client certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot). If you have created an account key with the official client and now want to use this key with this ansible role, you have to convert it. One tool which can do this is [pem-jwk](https://github.com/dannycoates/pem-jwk).

## Generated Files

Let's assume you created TLS keys for `www.example.com`. You have to copy the relevant files to your webserver. The ansible role created the following files:

  * `keys/www.example.com.key`: this is the private key for the certificate. Ensure nobody can access it.
  * `keys/www.example.com.pem`: this is the certificate itself.
  * `keys/www.example.com-chain.pem`: this is the intermediate certificate(s) needed for a trust path.
  * `keys/www.example.com.cnf`: this is an OpenSSL configuration file used to create the Certificate Signing Request. You can safely delete it.
  * `keys/www.example.com.csr`: this is the Certificate Signing Request used to obtain the certificate. You can safely delete it.
  * `keys/www.example.com-fullchain.pem`: this is the certificate combined with the intermediate certificate(s).
  * `keys/www.example.com-rootchain.pem`: this is the intermediate certificate(s) combined with the root certificate. You might need this for OCSP stapling.
  * `keys/www.example.com-root.pem`: this is the root certificate of Let's Encrypt.

For configuring your webserver, you need the private key (`keys/www.example.com.key`), and either the certificate with intermediate certificate(s) combined in one file (`keys/www.example.com-fullchain.pem`), or the certificate and the intermediate certificate(s) as two separate files (`keys/www.example.com.pem` and `keys/www.example.com-chain.pem`). If you want to use [OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling), you will also need `keys/www.example.com-rootchain.pem`.

To get these files onto your web server, you could add tasks as follows:

    - name: copy private keys
      copy: src=keys/{{ item }} dest=/etc/ssl/private/ owner=root group=root mode=0400
      with_items:
      - www.example.com.key
      notify: reload webserver

    - name: copy certificates
      copy: src=keys/{{ item }} dest=/etc/ssl/server-certs/ owner=root group=root mode=0444
      with_items:
      - www.example.com-rootchain.pem
      - www.example.com-fullchain.pem
      - www.example.com.pem
      notify: reload webserver

The webserver configuration could look as follows (for nginx):

    server {
        listen www.example.com:443 ssl;  # IPv4: listen to IP www.example.com points to
        listen [::]:443 ssl;             # IPv6: listen to localhost
        server_name www.example.com;
        
        # Allowing only TLS 1.0 and 1.2, with a very selective amount of ciphers.

        #   - Android 2.3.7
        #   - IE 6 and 8 under Windows XP
        #   - Java 6, 7 and 8
        # If that's not acceptable for you, choose other cipher lists. Look for
